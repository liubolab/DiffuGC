# DiffuGC
Granger causal discovery from time series data is fundamental for uncovering dynamic causal relationships in complex systems. However, most existing methods rely exclusively on observational data, which limits identifiability due to the constraints of Markov Equivalence Classes. Interventional data can potentially resolve these ambiguities, but real-world interventions are often unknown, imperfect, or heterogeneous—posing significant modeling challenges. In this paper, we propose DiffuGC, the first framework to integrate denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) into Granger causal discovery. By treating noise injection as a form of structured intervention and modeling the forward–reverse diffusion process as intervention-to-observation transitions, DiffuGC simulates a continuum from observational to perfect interventional time series without requiring prior knowledge of causal targets. Furthermore, a denoising Transformer is introduced to disentangle trend and seasonal components for accurate causal structure reconstruction from noisy interventional data. Extensive experiments on synthetic, nonlinear, and quasi-real datasets demonstrate that DiffuGC consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in high-dimensional and intervention-rich scenarios, thus advancing causal discovery in practical, heterogeneous time series systems.
